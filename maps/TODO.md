The gpx format that wikivoyage uses works with OSMAND. Useful! Either
autogenerate gpx from the geojson or find some other idea.

# Countries Viewer

- I have a geojson file for each, should I combine them into one big file
  instead? Does that not get too annoying to work with? Maybe instead a script
  that combines the existing one into one big motherload file.
- Could also then with tippecanoe convert it to an mbtiles, which I then
  convert to a pmtiles, which might be more efficient to load? More of a pain
  to add new countries then though.
